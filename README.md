## About the Game

Territory Conquest is a strategic area-control game where the objective is simple: eliminate all opponents by taking over their territories. 

Each territory you own generates units over time. Send your units to reinforce your own territories or to attack and conquer neutral or enemy-owned territories. The last player standing wins!
